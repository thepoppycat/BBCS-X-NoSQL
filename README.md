# BBCS-X-NoSQL

Hello! Welcome to BuildingBloCS 2020 NoSQL Workshop!

For this workshop, we would be using:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) as a remote server database for storing our data
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) as a online environment to run our code (as gitpod allows for some usage of terminal commands which we will be using later for importing our json file to the MongoDB server)

This workshop is split into 2 parts:
- In the first part, you will learn the **basics of NoSQL** (through the **CRUD** concept) as well as how to connect to MongoDB (remote server). All resources in the folder `Part1`.
- In the second part, you will learn the basics of **pipeline aggregation** in NoSQL and attempt to _find who stole the sacred BuildingBloCS logo_!!! Full story and resources in the folder `Part2`.
- Lastly, practice makes perfect, hence in the folder `AdditionalDatasets`, there are a few datasets (in the form of CSV files) for you to experiment with before the Amazing Race during BBCS20 Online Conference :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Before we begin, we would need to download MongoDB. In order to do this in Gitpod, we would need to configure  `.gitpod.dockerfile ` and `.gitpod.yml` files to use the dedicated MongoDB image built on top of gitpod/workspace-full.

Simply add the following line to .gitpod.dockerfile:

```
FROM gitpod/workspace-mongodb
```

Add the following line to .gitpod.yml:

```image:
  file: .gitpod.dockerfile
```
If you fork this repository, please ignore the lines above as the `.gitpod.dockerfile ` and `.gitpod.yml` files have already been configured before hand.

Note: if you are doing this locally you can [download the MongoDB Community Edition here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

Optional: Storing MongoDB’s data inside /workspace ensures that it will get backed up and restored properly when you stop and restart a workspace, or share a snapshot. Note this repository is not configure to do so (and will not be covered in the workshop). [Click here for instructions](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpodify/#running-init-scripts)

Next, edit README.md and change the `<username>`in the following line of markdown to your Github username such that you can click the button to open Gitpod.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/joelleoqiyi/BBCS-X-NoSQL)

Once you changed README.md, click the button above.

Once Gitpod is fully loaded, you would need to do a few things before starting out on the workshop:
- Install `dnspython` package through the terminal in Gitpod
  ```
  pip install dnspython
  ```
- Install `pymongo` package through the terminal in Gitpod
  ```
  pip install pymongo
  ```
- Check for the version of `MongoDB` (as well as whether it is in your workspace)
  ```
  mongod --version
  ```
  you should get a result similar to:
  ```
  db version v4.0.18
  git version: 6883g8d9j7f32176b1fd176df04da9165fd67
  OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.1d  10 Sep 2019
  allocator: tcmalloc
  modules: none
  build environment:
      distmod: ubuntu1804
      distarch: x86_64
      target_arch: x86_64
  ```

Once you edit finish your files in Gitpod, remember to save it and commit it to your Github Repository. [Check out how to do so here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/git/)

#### That should be all the set-up needed for Gitpod for this workshop! For any questions, feel free to ask us on Discord :relaxed:

**Full workshop steps will be written here after the workshop on 13th May 2020 (slides will be attached as well)**
